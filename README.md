# cnn_handwritten_recognition
handwritten recognition using convolutional neural network with keras with tensorflow backend.
The application load the ```model.dat``` file which is trained with mnist dataset.
For a better performance, the model is created with google colab at the link below
[colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1533wBU6YTbyH6iVbgj9ySWReyIPz9v-6).
The code load the model and try to guess what number you have drawn
